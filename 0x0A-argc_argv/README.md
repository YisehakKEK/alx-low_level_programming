# Command Line Arguments in C

This project focuses on understanding how to handle command-line arguments in C. It explores the two prototypes of the `main` function, the use of `(void)` or `__attribute__((unused))` to manage unused variables or parameters, and best practices for writing clean, standard-compliant code.

## Learning Objectives

- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are the two prototypes of `main` and when to use them
- How to compile functions with unused variables using `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)`

## Requirements

- All code follows the Betty style
- Compiled with: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- No global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All prototypes are in `main.h`
- Editors used: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- No plagiarism or code publication
