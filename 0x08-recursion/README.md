# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Project Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Programme curriculum focusing on recursion in the C programming language. The goal is to deepen understanding of recursion, a fundamental programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and explain what recursion is and its use cases.
- Implement various recursive functions to solve problems.
- Identify situations where recursion is beneficial and where it should be avoided.

## Requirements

- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Code must adhere to the Betty style.
- No use of global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Forbidden to use standard library functions like `printf` or `puts`.
- Mandatory use of `_putchar` for output.

## Tasks

Each task in this project involves implementing a specific recursive function to demonstrate the concepts learned. The tasks are designed to challenge and help solidify the understanding of recursion through practical implementation.
